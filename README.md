# CardSorting (Google Meet Relevance Analysis)

This repository contains **CardSorting Analysis** for my UX project made in May-June 2023 

## CardSorting Description (in general)

The method is used to check correctness and clarity (with closed sorting) or detect natural (with open sorting) categorization of some objects by users.

Direct application - "how to organize menus/navigation/themes on a site/in an application".

Research applications - identifying how users categorize something (features by purpose, importance-unimportance, ideas, etc.). Usually used when categories come from the interaction of many hidden reasons for categories (importance/personal interest/connection to something/...)

As a result of sorting, we get digital dimensions - clusters with quality and uncertainty metrics by cluster or objects, pictures of categories using multidimensional scaling.

The main concepts are
open, closed, hybrid card sorting; (dis)similarity matrix; distance; multidimensional scaling; hierarchical clustering

## My Personal Use of CardSorting 

**Service:** Google Meet

**Challenge:** Introduction of new features aimed at improving the User Experience during the call. Modification of existing features.

**Card sorting task:** prioritizing existing hypotheses (proposed new features to be introduced in the app).

**Rationale for change:** Google Meet is one of the world's most popular platforms for video conferencing, along with Zoom, Skype, and MS Teams. However, the platform still has significant shortcomings and limited functionality, that doesn't allow the service to become the absolute market leader.

A closer look at the "video conferencing platform" market shows tendency: each of these services has certain advantages and disadvantages to their competitors, and so far none of the companies has managed to create an "ultimatum" service service that could cover all requests from users. Google Meet was chosen as one of the two platforms used for lectures and seminars at the UX Analytics and Information Systems Design master's program. The suggested features for change were derived from a literature review, and based on the subjective suggestions of the author of the study
